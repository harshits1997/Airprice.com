Airline reservation System is a computerized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel. The project is aimed at exposing the relevance and importance of Airline Reservation Systems. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use of ARSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations.
This software has two parts. First is user part and the administrator part. User part is used as a front end and administrator is the back end. Administrator is used by airline authority. It will allow the customers to access database and allow new customers to sign up for online access.

The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.
After search the system display list of available flights and allows customer to choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then the system allows the passenger to book a seat. Otherwise it asks the user to choose another flight.

To book a flight the system asks the customer to enter his details such as name, address, city, state, and credit card number and contact number. Then it checks the validity of card and book the flight and update the airline database and user database. The system also allows the customer to cancel his/her reservation, if any problem occurs.
The main purpose of this software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the airline reservation process and make it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations, modify reservations or cancel a particular reservation.

# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

In this project, we implement an airline reservation website which is similar to Priceline.com. We assume that all of the fights are daily flights. A new user can create an account first, then search and add flights to his/her cart. There are two flight options provided for searching: one-way and round-trip, users can also filter the results according to whether or not there is an intermediate stop. An admin user can add, delete and update any flights. We make an assumption that all of the operations are cascading.

# Languages Used for Implementation:
•	PHP 5 - for server side scripting.

•	Javascript/JQuery/Ajax - for client side scripting.

•	Bootstrap/CSS - for design the web pages.

You can refer to the SQL Code for database creation in the file named: sql_code
For images you can refer to the various PNG files that have been uploaded.
